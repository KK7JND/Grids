# Overview
This program is a companion program to the js8call monitor python script. It is designed to export a list of callsigns and matching grid squares from a HamCall application database. The js8call monitor script then uses this data to resolve missing grid squares from received messages without requiring internet access.

While HamCall and this application both require Windows, once the export is complete it can be moved to the machine where you are running the js8call monitor script, and that machine does not have to be running windows.
# Prerequisites
- Microsoft Window XP or Higher
- HamCall DVD, USB, or digital download
 -30 Meg of free RAM on the machine running the js8call_monitor script
