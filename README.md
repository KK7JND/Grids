# Grids
This program is a companion program to JS8Call Monitor. It is designed to export a list of callsigns and matching grid squares from a HamCall application database. JS8Call Monitor then uses this data to resolve missing grid squares from received messages without requiring internet access.

While HamCall and this application both require Windows, once the export is complete it can be moved to the machine where you are running JS8Call Monitor, and that machine does not have to be running windows.
# Prerequisites
- Microsoft Window XP or Higher
- HamCall DVD, USB, or digital download
- 30 Meg of free RAM on the machine running Js8Call Monitor
